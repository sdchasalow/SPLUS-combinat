#
#   DESCRIPTION:
#         Generate all points on a hypercuboid lattice. 
#         Argument x is an integer vector giving the extent of each dimension; 
#         the number of dimensions is length(x).  
#         Argument scale is a vector of real numbers giving an amount by which 
#         to multiply the points in each dimension;  it will be replicated as 
#         necessary to have the same length as x.
#         Argument translate is a vector of real numbers giving an amount to 
#         translate (from the "origin", rep(1,length(x))) the points in each 
#         dimension;  it will be replicated as necessary to have the same 
#         length as x.  To use rep(0,length(x)) as the origin,  use 
#         translation = -1.  Scaling,  if any,  is done BEFORE translation.
#
#   VALUE:
#         A prod(x) by length(x) numeric matrix;  element (i,j) gives the 
#         location of point i in the jth dimension.  The first column 
#         (dimension) varies most rapidly.
